dart-websocket_rails
====================

pub package to communicat with a websocket managed by websocket-rails gem

WIP
===

It's mostly translated from the CoffeeScript at [websocket-rails/websocket-rails/tree/master/lib/assets/javascripts/websocket_rails](https://github.com/websocket-rails/websocket-rails/tree/master/lib/assets/javascripts/websocket_rails)

Cuz of that the style is VERY bad for now and not even close to dart-mechanics
